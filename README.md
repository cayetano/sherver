Sherver
=======

Pure Bash lightweight web server.

Easy solution to setup a **local** website without any server configuration!!!

This is inspired by [bashttpd](https://github.com/avleen/bashttpd). Though, the behavior is entirely different. See below for more information.

### How to run ###

Just clone and run `./miniserver.sh`. Then, you should be able to connect to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/). You can pass the port to listen on as a parameter: `./miniserver.sh 8081`.

### Requirements ###

This is made to run with `Bash`. It may not work in another shell. The following tools need to be present in the system (note that they are all part of the default installation of Debian):
- `mimetype` command, used to get the mimetype of the files.
	- you can change it by `file` if you prefer. just change the `send_file` function in [scripts/SHERVER_UTILS.sh](./scripts/SHERVER_UTILS.sh)
- `envsubst` if you want to do templating
- `python` used to stream binary files. Python 2 or 3 can be used.
	- default is Python 3, if you want to use Python 2, you'll have to change one line in the `send_file` function in [scripts/SHERVER_UTILS.sh](./scripts/SHERVER_UTILS.sh)
- `socat` to run the server.
	- you can use `netcat` instead, but it doesn't work well with concurrent HTTP requests

### Features ###

Sherver is a web server that implements part of HTTP 1.0. Even if it is written in a few lines of Bash, it is able to do a lot:
- no configuration needed: you can just add files either in `scripts` or in `file` folders
- serve any HTML page no matter how complexe (with advanced JavaScript and multiple scripts or files to download...)
- serve files (text or binary, pictures...) with correct mime type
- dynamic pages
- templated HTML so you don't have to duplicate headers and footers
- parse of URL query string
- support for GET and POST
- deal with client cache resources
- easily extandable
	- can run any scripts or executable of any languages as soon as they output something on `stdout`
	- comes with a library of bash functions to ease the use

Even if it sounds awesome, Sherver still has the following limitations:
- only support HTTP GET and POST requests, though it would be easy to add the others
- no concurrency
	- if a page needs to download a lot of files, the files are sent one after the other
	- if 2 users access the website, the second one needs to wait until the first one is fully served
- no security (see below)

This is why Sherver is supposed to remain in a private and controlled environment. **Do not expose Sherver on Internet!!!** If you want to expose your site on Internet, you should use a tool that knows about security and concurrency.

**Always run Sherver behind a firewall that prevent any intrusions from outside**.
