Sherver
=======

Pure Bash lightweight web server.

Easy solution to setup a **local** website without any server configuration!!!

This is inspired by [bashttpd](https://github.com/avleen/bashttpd). Though, the behavior is entirely different. See below for more information.

How to run
----------

Just clone and run `./miniserver.sh`. Then, you should be able to connect to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

Requirements
------------

This is made to run with `Bash`. It may not work in another shell. The following tools need to be present in the system (note that they are all part of the default installation of Debian):
- `mimetype` command, used to get the mimetype of the files.
	- you can change it by `file` if you prefer. just change the `send_file` function in [scripts/SHERVER_UTILS.sh](./scripts/SHERVER_UTILS.sh)
- `python` used to stream binary files. Python 2 or 3 can be used.
	- default is Python 3, if you want to use Python 2, you'll have to change one line in the `send_file` function in [scripts/SHERVER_UTILS.sh](./scripts/SHERVER_UTILS.sh)
- `socat` to run the server. Socat is installed by default on Debian.
	- you can use `netcat` instead, but it doesn't work well with concurrent HTTP requests

More documentation later...
